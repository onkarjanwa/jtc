## About us
Jai started JTC in 2016 after realizing that there are a lot of businesses who are always looking for reliable technology partners to help them deliver solutions. Before JTC, he spent a decade working with Microsoft, Google, Startups where he leads engineering teams.

Our primary nature of the business is technology consulting and implementation of software systems. Our technology consultants bring clients on board by pitching software solutions and our software engineers work with clients to deliver them. We do not have frontend engineers, backend engineers, project managers. Our engineers take full ownership of features and work alongside with customers to deliver.

We often work on few products of our own as well. If you are looking to work with us, talk to your hiring manager to learn more about our works.

## Engineering:

### Interview process
Our interview process for an engineering role consists of two steps:

- Build an application:
  - For full stack developer role, build a web application using MEAN / MERN stack. Please see this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wX61rB-TpK6xckr-FBckDKkeH2qbwNlATSEDOX73QCY/edit?usp=sharing) on what to build.
  - For mobile engineer role, build a mobile application using React Native. Please see this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIe1qWiQUeKZ8vYPeWe9FANiFmgpxvCHTN7Tws241U0/edit?usp=sharing) on what to build.
- Once you have finished above task, set up a 1hr 15 mins interview call with us. You would need access to a computer and the internet during this call. Please use this [link](https://www.meetingbird.com/l/jjalan/interview) to schedule the meeting. In this call, we would:
  - Solve a technical problem for about 45 minutes
  - Go over the application and its source code of the application you built in step 1.

If everything goes well, we will make you an offer.

### Software development process
We follow the agile methodology. It all starts with sprint planning. Team members get together on a particular day of a week (Monday in our case), talks about new user scenarios that need to be enabled as well bugs, if any, that needs to be addressed. The work is estimated in story points and planned (factoring any upcoming time offs) for the sprint. Our sprint is usually a week long. All the work is managed in JIRA.


We use Gitflow branching model and Github for source control. For every task, bug, or story, we create a feature branch. Ex: Consider a story in JIRA:  SEQP-10 â€“ User should see an error message if they entered wrong username or password.
```
git hf feature start SEQP-10/error_message_wrong_username_password
```

We use Hubflow (a set of helper scripts) that does all plumbing work to enforce Gitflow branching model. Once all the changes are made and automated tests are written, changes are committed.

Before a commit can be made locally, our bot ensure that changes follow coding standards and run all automated tests to ensure the changes do not break existing scenarios. In case it breaks, our system does not allow the commit.

At this stage, the engineer who made the change goes to Github and raise a pull request (PR). With each PR, they write a detailed description of the changes made, document manual test cases ran, automated tests cases added, and various devices the changes were tested. S/he then assigns relevant engineers to review the code. Our system automatically deploys just those changes to a new endpoint (for web-based projects). Each PR goes through a detailed code review. Here are a few things a reviewer looks for:

1. Reviewer tests the changes on the endpoint to make sure it does what it was supposed to do.
2. Proper comments have been added to the code.
3. Variables and functions are named correctly.
4. Proper validations and null checks are in place.
5. Relevant automated test cases have been added to cover new code path.
6. Proper error logging is done to ensure we can debug the issue in production in case an issue occurs.
7. The code is architected correctly and follows SOLID design principles.
8. Think about all various scenarios these changes might affect.
9. Does user experience make sense? Is it responsive? Does it render well when user zoom in  or zoom out?
10. Performance implications (time and memory)

Once the reviewer approves the changes, the PR is merged and developer moves on to next tasks. Note that we do not have a separate QA team and our engineers own everything from building the feature to testing and monitoring.

As soon the changes are merged, our system auto deploys them to a staging server. At the end of the sprint, the product owner (often our customer) verifies the changes. Once the changes are verified, we release them to production. We have set up monitors on our servers and if there are any errors, bug or crashes that happens, our team gets immediately notified on a Slack channel. Yes, we use Slack for our team communication.

The project team members do a daily standup to talks about the progress they have made yesterday, what they plan to work on today as well as any blocking issues. This makes sure that everyone is on the same page and any blocking issues are surfaced early on.

#### Release Checklist
- All tagged tickets should be marked as `CLOSED`.
- Perform build and run-time checks at staging.
- Perform configuration checks at production application in the pipeline.
- Verify the milestone tag for pull requests at GitHub. Create a new milestone if required.
- Verify the `Fix Version(s)` / `Affects Version(s)` field(s) for tickets at JIRA. Create a new release if required.
- Initiate release phase via `git hf release start <release-tag-here>`
- Bump the package version (Eg: `version` field in `package.json`).
- Commit changes with meaningful commit message(s) as they will be directly in the commit history at `master`.
- Finish the release phase via `git hf release finish <release-tag-here>`
- Close the milestone at GitHub.
- Complete at release at JIRA.
- Submit release notes.

#### Creating hotfixes

- Create a hotfix under release in JIRA. We follow semver (https://semver.org/) so hotfix should generally update only PATCH number.
- Tag tickets in JIRA that needs to go out with hotfix.
- Create a hotfix branch. Please see hubflow to see what this command does.
```
git hf hotfix start VERSION_NUMBER
```
- Create feature branch for the ticket that needs to go out with hotfix. The feature branch should derive from hotfix branch instead of develop branch.
```git checkout -b feature/TICKET_NUMBER/TICKET_DESCRIPTION hotfix/VERSION_NUMBER```
- Raise PR. The base branch in PR should be `hotfix/VERSION_NUMBR` branch.
- Once all tickets are merged, checkout hotfix branch

```
git checkout hotfix/VERSION_NUMBR
```

```
git pull
```

- Update version number in `package.json` to VERSION_NUMBER
- Release hotfix
```
git hf hotfix finish VERSION_NUMBER
```
